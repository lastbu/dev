.Enabling Ansible server IP for duplication with client for webapp deployment
First step up is
Launching of two ec2 instances one consisting of ansible host and control server respectively Note: for security group you need to enable only ssh 22
And launch the two instances Open client mobaxterm SSH
Copy public IP of host and control server ansible from AWS that have recently launced
In Control Server follow this procedure
$sudo su –
$ yum update
In ansible client
$sudo su –
$ yum update
In Control Server follow this procedure
$ yum install ansible
$ rpm –Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
$ yum install ansible
$ ansible --version
$ useradd ansadmin
There should be file by name .ssh or else error Go to ansible client
$ ifconfig
This gives you the private ip of your ansible client and copy this IP In Duplicate control server tab
$ cd .ssh
$ ls
$ ssh-copy-id <private ip of ansible client> //this is how you deploy several clients in to server control area dynamically//
Below snap shot result with copy without authentication Note: if it asks the password than its an error
To come out of client ip
$ ssh <client private ip>
$ exit
Connection will be closed
To execute and deploy features of ansible configuration in devops strategy , in duplicate server follow the procedure
$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
Delete the content and type the following this way like snapshot
For reference we a have taken an example IP , you go to type your respective host/client IP
$ ansible all –m ping
$ls
$ cd ..
$ls
$pwd
$cat > hello.html
<h1> hello welcome .. welcome to devops </h1>
$ls
Displays hello.html file

In your ansible client
$cd /home/ansadmin

$ls

$pwd

$ls
Go back to your control server

$ ansible all –m copy “src=/home/amsadmin/hello.html dest=/home/ansadmin” In your client
$ls -l

This is the final output
